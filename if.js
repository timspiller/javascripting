// Below is a good fruit, in JS we call this fruit a string. This string is represented by a variable.
var fruit = 'Orange';

// Below is the character length of the var fruit value 'Orange'
var length = fruit.length;

// Lets let the length variable do the work.
if (length === 10) {
  console.log("hello! We counted the damn string with a variable string finally. This shit isn't set static brah");

} else {
  console.log("jai is awesome");

}
